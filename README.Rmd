# SurvivalHazardExtraction

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Lifecycle: experimental](https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-experimental-orange.svg)](https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#experimental)
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of SurvivalHazardExtraction is to assist researchers working on health economic models that includes survival data. Specifically, when trying to build out cost-effective models with transition probabilities dependent on various correlated parameters, this shiny app will facilitate extracting the variance covariance as well as correlation matrices in order to generate estimates of ICER in a probabilistic framework.

## Installation

You can install SurvivalHazardExtraction via:

``` r
devtools::install_github("ck2136/SurvivalHazardExtraction")
```

## Running the Shiny App

The easiest way to run the app is to clone the repo into a folder then opening the project via Rstudio. Afterwards, execute the `R/run_dev.R` code and a local shiny app will be executed.
